**First principle:** (*Store*)

***All of our states are stored in a *single object.* Then the object is managed by Redux Store.***

**Second Principle:**  (*Action*)

State is read only . The only way  to change the state is by *Emit (dispatch)* action which describing what happened.

**Third Principle:**  (*Reducer* )
The third principle covers how should a state transform.

To specify how the state tree is changed by actions, you write *pure Reducers*

- *Pure Reducer* is a  *function* which takes *(previousState, actions )* as an input and returns a new state.
- So being on a *Pure function* instead of *updating* the state it should *return a new state*

**Overview:**

- The *JavaScript app* is subscribed to the redux store but we cannot update them directly.
- If the app want to update the state it should be *dispatch* an *Action*.
- After the dispatch the *Reducer  handles* the action and update the current state.
- As soon as the value is *updated* the *value* is passed to the JS app because the app is Subscribed to the store.
