It is a contains a single store for the entire application

**Responsibilities of store:**
- Holds the  *State*  of  the application
- It expresses the method called *getstate()* which gives application *access* to the *state* it holds.
- It provides an method called *dispatch(action)* to *update* the *state* of the app, the dispatch method accepts an *action* as an *argument*.
- The store allows the app to register *listeners* via *subscribe(listeners)*. The subscribe method accepts a *function* as an *argument* which executed anytime when the state in the *store changes*.
- We can also *unsubscribe* to the *store* by calling the function that was *returned* by the *subscribed* function  Eg: subscribe (listener).

**Implementation:**
- import the redux store,
- The redux library provide a method called *create store*  for creating the store 
- now we implement the *getState()* method
- allow the app to make changes in the store by using the *subscribe method*,the subscribe method *accepts* the  function
- The store provides *dispatch* method to update the state, the dispatch function accepts the *action* as a parameter
