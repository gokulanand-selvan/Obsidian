It is a contains a single store for the entire application

**Responsibilities of store:**
- Holds the  *State*  of  the application
- It expresses the method called *getstate()* which gives application *access* to the *state* it holds.
- It provides an method called *dispatch(action)* to *update* the *state* of the app, the dispatch method accepts an *action* as an *argument*.
- The store allows the app to register *listeners* via *subscribe(listeners)*. The subscribe method accepts a *function* as an *argument* which executed anytime when the state in the *store changes*.
- We can also *unsubscribe* to the *store* by calling the function that was *returned* by the *subscribed* function  Eg: subscribe (listener).

**Implementation:**
- import the redux store,
- The redux library provide a method called *create store*  for creating the store 
- now we implement the *getState()* method
- allow the app to make changes in the store by using the *subscribe method*,the subscribe method *accepts* the  function
- The store provides *dispatch* method to update the state, the dispatch function accepts the *action* as a parameter


```js
// 1 Action).first we define the sting constant that indicates the type of the action

  

// 3 store).namba react la import pandra maari inga namba import pannikalam

const redux = require("redux");

  

//  3.store). The redux library provide a method called *create store*  for creating the store

const createStore = redux.createStore;

  

const CAKE_ORDERED = "CAKE_ORDERED"; //1 action). this aviods the spelling mistakes when we reusing the action,its not compulsory to declare but everyom=ne is following this method

  

// now we define our action Remember the action is an object that has "type" property

  

// action creator. here the action creator (function) returns the action buyCake()

function orderCake() {

  return (

    // object

    {

      // property is "type" and the "value" is CAKE_ORDERED

      type: CAKE_ORDERED,

      quantity: 1,

    }

  );

}

// Reducer:

  

// We need two arguments to write a reducer function i.e the state of the application before making any change and action.

  

// (previousState, action) =>newState

// Here we already declared the "action" so now we determine the "state"

  

const initialState = () => {

  numOfCakes: 10;

};

// we pass the "initialState" as the default value for the state parameter in the reducer as arguments

  

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {

  //Refer switch in obsidian

  switch (action.type) {

    case CAKE_ORDERED:

      return {

        numOfCakes: state.numOfCakes - 1,

      };

    default:

      return state;

  }

};

  

// 3.store). the 'createStore accepts a function  "reducer'

const store = createStore(reducer);

console.log("Initial State", store.getState());

// 3.store). implementing the "subscribe" method, the subscribe method can accepts a function

store.subscribe(() => console.log("updated state", store.getState()));

// 3.store). implementing the "dispatch" method, the dispatch method can accepts "action as its parameter"

// namba direct ah actin ae kudukalam but inga namba action creator use panni irukom so we use it

store.dispatch(orderCake());
