# **1)What are components and why react all about them?**

# **2) How components are build?**

# **3)Analyzing the standard project in react (Must watch)**

# **4)What is Jsx?**

# **5)How React works?**

# **6) Building a custom React Component:**

Here the reason for using First letter as caps in Jsx because React consider small case Elements are HTML and the Jsx JavaScript function as caps starting.

```js
<h2> =>HTML,
<App /> =>JavaScript
```

# **7) Writing Complex Jsx code**

# **8) Adding basic CSS styling**

# **9) Outputting a dynamic data &writing with Expression in Jsx**

# **10) Passing data via Props**

# **11) Concept of "composition:"**

So we pass data through components via props. Here we face some code duplication. Thus we use composition which the regular Div which act as a container can be replaced by writing a new function which contains common code.

In that care the shell Div which contains Children, Here the children are not acceptable because we didn't call it so we pass it as props but not with attributes but as syntax =>{props.children}.
