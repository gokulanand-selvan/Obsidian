# **1) Intro**

# **2) Listing Events & Working with Event Handlers**

# **3) How component Functions are Executed**

It is Recommend that while using events we can name Handlers at end of the name.

```js
const pressHandeler=()=> {tittle= "updated"};
<button onClick={pressHandler}> Press Me </button>
```


# **4) Working with "State"**

# **5) A closer look at the "useState" Hook**

 # **6)State can be updated in many ways!**

Thus far, we update our state **upon user events** (e.g. upon a click).

That's very common but not required for state updates! **You can update states for whatever reason you may have**.

Later in the course, we'll see Http requests that complete (where we then want to update the state based on the Http response we got back) but you could also be updating state because a timer (set with `setTimeout()`) expired for example.

# **7) Listening to user Input :**

# **8) Working with multiple states:**

# **9) Updating the state depends upon the previous state :** 

# **10) Adding two way binding:** 

The way binding helpful when we are working with FORMS, because it allows you to gather input but then it also change it.
