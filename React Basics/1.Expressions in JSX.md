You can put any valid [JavaScript expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Expressions) inside the curly braces in JSX.

```JSX
const name = 'Josh Perez';const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
```

**Jsx is an Expression too**:

you can use JSX inside of `if` statements and `for` loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from function

You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:

```
const element = <a href="https://www.reactjs.org"> link </a>;
```

You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:

```
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
```

*Don’t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute.*

### JSX Prevents Injection Attacks

It is safe to embed user input in JSX:

```
const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;
```

*By default, React DOM [escapes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381974/which-characters-need-to-be-escaped-on-html) any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent [XSS (cross-site-scripting)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attacks.*


### JSX Represents Objects

Babel compiles JSX down to `React.createElement()` calls.

These two examples are identical:

```
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
```

```
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

`React.createElement()` performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:

```
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```

***These objects are called “React elements”. You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.***
