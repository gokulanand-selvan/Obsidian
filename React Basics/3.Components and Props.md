Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

**Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.



## Function and Class Components

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

***Props*

When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.
