## What does USB stand for?

USB stands for Universal Serial Bus, and it represents an [industry standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB/) for cables, connectors and communications protocols, used for the connection, communication, and power supply between various computing devices. It is used by a very large variety of devices, ranging from the common keyboard and mouse to cameras, printers, scanners, flash drives, external hard drives, smartphones, tablets, TVs and so on.

## USB versions and data transfer speeds

Since it was first developed, the USB interface kept on getting faster with each revision. Here are the main revisions or versions of USB:

1.  _USB 1.0_ and _USB 1.1_- were the first iterations of the USB interface, released in 1996 and 1998 respectively, and they were capable of data transfers of up to 1.5 Mbps, respectively 12 Mbps. At the time when they were developed, _USB 1.0_ was also known as _Low Speed USB_, while the _USB 1.1_ was known as _Fast Speed USB_.
    
2.  _USB 2.0_ - also known as _Hi-Speed USB_, was released in April 2000 and it supports maximum theoretical data transfer speeds of up to 480 Mbps. In reality, the maximum effective throughput is limited to 280 Mbps or 35 MB/s. _USB 2.0_ is backward compatible with _USB 1.0_ and _USB 1.1_, meaning that you can use old devices with _USB 1.x_ ports to connect to newer devices that have _USB 2.0_ ports.
    
3.  _USB 3.0_ - came to life in November 2008 and it is also known as _SuperSpeed USB_. It can support theoretical data transfer speeds of up to 5 Gbps, but the real-life speeds you can get on it are around 3.2 Gbps or 400 MB/s.
    
4.  _USB 3.1_ - was released in July 2013 and is also known as _SuperSpeed+ USB_. It is capable of theoretical data transfers of 10 Gbps, double that of _USB 3.0_. In reality, the maximum achievable transfer speed is of 7.2 Gbps or 900 MB/s.
