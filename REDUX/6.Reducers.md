**Reducers**

- Reducers specify the  app's changes in response to the *actions*  sent to the store.
- In programming terms Reducer is *function* that accepts the *state and action* as an *arguments*, and *returns* the *next state* of the application.
- (previousState , action) => newState
- We need two arguments to write a reducer function i.e. the state of the application before making any change and action.
- that is if we are working with the multiple objects ,it is safer to create an copy of the previous state by using the spread operators (...)
