You should hire me for this positionÂ because of my proven ability to build efficient front-end user interfaces in line with modern best practices. I have some experience in React framework, to develop front-end applications.




I have been working with react for 3 months, I've trained by my friend who is a React developer. I've done MechOnway (My own idea) and Apple Website clone with Html and Css. With React I've done my portfolio, a TODO web app, personal Portfolio, Calculator and I currently working with a Expense Tracker web app (you can see them in my Github). As I have knowledge with basics can rate myself 5 out of 10.
