What is OOP?

To know what is OOP 1st we should know what is *object* so 1st we know about object we should know what is *primitive data type*?

**1.Primitive data types:**

- int 
- float
- char
- Boolean 
- double ,etc...

These are the called  primitive data types because *they are already Eluthi vachirukanga* these are called  **simple data**.

**2.Simple Data:**
 simple data na we already know that what these data type can do i.e. Boolean can do true or false like that, we can tell what the data type do. ***so primitive la namba single data va store panni vekka mudium.***
 
 **3.Complex  Data:**

In complex data type we can *group tne primitive data types in a group.*  i.e.. we can store multiple primitive data in one group.

For that grouping they gave us ***Classes** and ***objects***. With these we can do OOP. 

**4.What is an object?**

bject is an instance(உதாரணம்) of *class.*

*what is class?*
class is an template for objects.

**5.Relation Between Class and object:**

**6.Explaination to Class=Template and object=Data**

Enemies are common but they are different like turtle, jetty man, dragon etc. .They have different data. so class is a template and with that template we can create different data.
